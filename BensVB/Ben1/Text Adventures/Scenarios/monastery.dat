The Graveyard
You come to a gloomy courtyard inside low walls of stone.  A lone dead tree leans precariously over one wall.  There are what appear to be tombstones scattered about, in various states of decay.

Examine Tombstones
You bend down to examine the tombstones.  You can't read anything on them because they are caked with mud and moss.  You'd scrape it off, but you don't want to get your fingernails dirty.

North Side
You come around to the north side of the building.  There you find a man sitting on a stool painting a landscape of the picturesque valley.  Actually, it's not all that picturesque, but oh well.

Storeroom
You come to a door and are surprised to find it unlocked.  Once inside, you realize that this room must be a storeroom of some sort - bottles and jars line the walls.  On a shelf are some interesting looking BOTTLES of blue potion.

sleeping artist
You casually slide the potion within the reach of the artist.  He reflexively grabs it and drinks it all before you can stop him.  He proceeds to fall asleep.  You steal his paint scraper just for the fun of it.  [type "go" to continue]
