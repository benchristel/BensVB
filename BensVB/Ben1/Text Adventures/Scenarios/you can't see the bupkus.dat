the sandwich appears to just be some stale bread, with a bit of butter smeared on the inner surfaces.  you can't see the bupkus.  It looks just fine, except for a small chunk of drippy yellow stuff on it.  It looks like honey....

you attack the walls of your cell viciously with the skewer.  It is easy to dig into, because it is made of wax.  Not a very sturdy cell, you think.  finally you break through into a  hallway.  lining the walls there are more cells, all made of the same yellowish wax.  looking up, something falls on your face.  it is a piece of paper, wet with honey.

The paper says, "you have been chosen to find the missing bupkus of the honey bees that will soon destroy the world if you don't find the bupkus.  SO GET LOOKING!"

you walk stickily southward, untill you come to another wall of cells, like yours but smaller.  there doesn't appear to be any way to go further.

using your skewer, you climb up the wall of wax.  your skewer sinks deep into the wall, like you hit a pocket of air.
