"I just downloaded a copy of LangMaker, and I have three words to say... FAB YOO LUS!!!!" - Moreland Clinton Michael

"LangMaker is a wonderful tool for creating a entire lexicon for a constructed language. Its ability to create a consistent language family and history are superb. Definitely a must for any conlanger!" -  Martin Greening

"It looks great. I've been tinkering with it for a couple hours, trying to get it to output just the right shapes of words in the right amounts. It's a wonderful program." - Chris Collins

"Speaking of the WWW pages [and the Web Wizard], congrats on thinking of such a useful tool!  I was very impressed with this." - Matt Smith, http://www.crystal-mtn.com/users/msmith/matt.htm

"LangMaker is a terrific program. The transform feature is a very powerful tool;  my sound shifts should be seamless, accurate and complete. Never could get that done right on paper." - Tom Hackett

"I have been very happy with what I have been able to do with the version I recently downloaded. I have had no problem running it on either of my computers, and it does exactly what I want a word generator to do.  Thanks for making this available." - Mia Soderquist

"Just wanted to tell you again how much I enjoy Language Maker.  It's great fun...  You know, I've been able to pick out 'roots' from completely random vocabularies?  ...  Anyway, thanks for the program."  - Pat Dunn, Jr.

"I also thank you again for your page.  This was a sort of hidden hobby of mine that never usually got beyond a bit of grammar and a small lexicon for the hundreds of languages I started but never finished.  With your resources and examples, I hope to finish one some day." - Marco Fabiani


THANKS!

Thanks for downloading LangMaker.  If you have any questions about how to use it or any suggestions, please contact me by e-mail at langmaker@langmaker.com.

To use the program, create a new directory on your hard drive, and unzip the files into that directory.  Restart Windows and run LANGMAKE.EXE.  That's it!  (But, since this involves computers, check out the Troubleshooting section below.)


TROUBLESHOOTING

If you can't get LangMaker to run, make sure to try each of the following:

[  ]  Keeping all files together in their own directory and running LANGMAKE.EXE from that
[  ]  Copying all the *.vbx and *.dll files into the Windows\System directory and then running the program
[  ]  As a last resort, copying all the *.vbx files (not the *.dll files) into the Windows directory and running the program

If, when you copy the *.vbx and *.dll files, there are other versions already present, copy over them if they are older versions than the ones included with LangMaker, otherwise:  1) backup your existing versions of these files and 2) then copy over them.

It's best to restart Windows after copying these VBX and DLL files to other directories.

(VBX and DLL files may be shared among applications.  The benefit is that it keeps the size of applications smaller, but the disadvantage is that it leads to conflicts among applications.  It's a flaw in the design of Windows that the operating system does not provide better automatic management of these components.)

If this doesn't work, please contact me by e-mail.
