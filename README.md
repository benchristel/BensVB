# BensVB - Archival README

Between 1998 and 2007 (ages 8–17) I wrote programs in Visual Basic. This repo archives those programs.

All my work resided in a directory called `BensVB` on my Dad's Windows XP machine.

## Guide to files

Most of the interesting stuff is in `BensVB/Ben1/`. Check out the `.frm` files—that's where most of the code is.

### `BensVB/README.TXT`

Jeffrey Henning's `LangMaker` is a program that generates words for constructed languages.
At some point I copied it into the `BensVB` directory (probably from a zip archive) and left its files strewn about ever after. The README.TXT comes from `LangMaker`. The `*.LEX` files (with the exception of `ORCNAMES.LEX`), as
well as the `*.LX*` files (I didn't understand how file extensions were supposed to work back then) are data that I created to feed to `LangMaker`.
